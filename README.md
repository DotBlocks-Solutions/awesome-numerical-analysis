A curated list of FOSS tools for the numerical analysis of engineering problems.

The tools are categorized as follows:
- [Pre-processors](pre-processors)
- [Solvers](solvers)
- [Post-processors](post-processors)

# Pre-processors

- [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) — an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size
- [SALOME](https://git.salome-platform.org/gitweb/) — a platform that provides engineers/researchers/practitioners with a solution that allows them to benefit from high-level modules targeting: CAD, meshing, coupling of phenomena, visualisation, calculation supervision, uncertainties, etc...

# Solvers

- [FEniCS](https://github.com/FEniCS) — a popular open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
- [OpenFOAM](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam) — a free, open source CFD software released and developed by OpenCFD Ltd since 2004
- [Deal.ii](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) — a C++ program library targeted at the computational solution of partial differential equations using adaptive finite elements
- [Elmer](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem) — a tool that can solve a large number of partial differential equations making it an ideal tool for multiphysical problems
- [SU2](https://github.com/su2code/SU2) — an open-source suite for multiphysics simulation and design
- [DUNE](https://github.com/dune-project/dune-common) — the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations with grid-based methods
- [FreeFEM](https://github.com/FreeFem/FreeFem-sources) — a partial differential equation solver for non-linear multi-physics systems in 2D and 3D using the finite element method
- [Code_Aster](https://gitlab.com/codeaster/src) — Analysis of Structures and Thermomechanics for Studies and Research

# Post-processors

- [ParaView](https://github.com/Kitware/ParaView) — an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application based on Visualization Toolkit ([VTK](https://vtk.org/))
